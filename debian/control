Description: An IRC bot, written in erlang, not an eggdrop.
 Manderlbot is an IRC bot with XML configuration file, allowing you to launch
 it on several servers and channels at once, each channel will have its own
 set of behaviours.
 .
 Behaviours are generics, and you cad easily make your own set. If you want
 some not-already-implemented generic behaviour, you'll have to code some
 erlang !
